  gameText: Alright, I'll use everything here and reinforce doors and windows. If
    I do this right, I might be able to turn this temporary shelter into a full blown
    survival residence. I take my time, but now everything above ground is boarded
    up. Shouldn't have to worry too much for the rest of the night.
