  gameText: I found shelter in a secluded house in the woods. All the lights are
    off so I have some time before the monsters find me. If I can make it until morning,
    I might be able to get out in one piece. Through the darkness, I can see a set
    of stairs leading to the basement. Do I check out the basement or scout the ground
    floor?
