  gameText: What a magnificent workshop! Every tool I could possibly need to turn
    this place into a fort is in this room. There are also a lot of things I could
    use to protect myself. I could reinforce the defences of the house or I could
    try to outfit myself. I better only do one. I don't have much time.
